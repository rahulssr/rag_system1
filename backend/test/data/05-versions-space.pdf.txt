Instructions: 
1.  Only those candidates who have taken the Common Admission Test (CAT 2023) are entitled to receive the score card. Keep a print-out of this
score card for your information pertaining to CAT 2023. You will not receive the score card by email or by post.
2.  The Overall Scaled Score is the sum of the scaled scores of the candidate in the three sections.
3.  Percentile refers to the percentage of candidates who receive a scaled score less than or equal to the scaled score obtained by the candidate.
4.  IIMs and Non-IIM member institutions independently decide how to use CAT 2023 score s in line with their own selection process. The scores are
to be used only for selecting the candidates to their respective Post Graduate/Doctoral (Fellow) Programme(s) in Management.
5.  Detection of instances of incorrect information and process violation by a candidate at any stage will lead to disqualification of the candidate. CAT
scores of such candidates who are disqualified will become null and void. Such disqualified candidates will not be allowed to appear for CAT in
future. If such instances go undetected during the current selection process but are detected in subsequent years, such disqualification and the
associated penalties will take place with retrospective effect.
6.  All queries regarding post-CAT 2023 selection process must be directed to the respective IIMs. CAT Centre will not answer post-CAT queries.
7.  CAT 2023 score is valid only until 31st December 2024 and is subject to the candidate meeting the minimum eligibility marks in the qualifying
